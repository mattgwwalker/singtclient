    <h1>Virtual Choir Client: Mockup Interface</h1>

    <p>This is version 0.1 of software that allows participation in a
    Virtual Choir rehearsal.  It will allow you to connect to a
    rehearsal space and participate in a joint rehearsal.  You will be
    able to hear others, talk to them, and sing together.  The
    conductor will be able to hear everyone as they sing (synchronised
    and in real-time) and you will be able to hear everyone after
    you've finished each recording.</p>

    
    <h2>Setup</h2>

    <p>This software does not have echo cancelling.  As a consequence,
    it's very important that your microphone cannot hear your
    speakers.  The easiest solution is to wear headphones when
    connected to a rehearsal space.</p>
    

    <h2>Setting the Microphone's Level</h2>
    
    <p>The first step is to ensure that we have set an appropriate
    level for your microphone.  You will be recorded for a few seconds
    and during that time you need to sing loudly.  If you adjust your
    microphone, or you adjust your position relative to your
    microphone, then you may have to repeat this process.</p>

    <p>Press the button "Set Gain for Singing".  Sing loudly.</p>

    <button>Set Gain for Singing</button>

    <p>A peak of -23dB was detected, that's not too bad.  You might
    want to consider adjusting things so that you're closer to the
    microphone and then repeat the process.</p>

    
    <h2>Connecting</h2>

    <p>After setting the microphone's level, you will want to connect
    to the rehearsal space.  The connection details were shared with
    you by email.  Enter them in the box below.</p>

    <input type="text">

    <p>Next, enter your name in the box below.  This will be displayed
    to those in the rehearsal space.</p>

    <input type="text">

    <p>When you're ready, press the "Connect" button below.  You will
    then join the rehearsal and be able to hear and speak with the
    others in the choir.</p>

    <button>Connect</button>

    
    <h2>Muting</h2>

    <p>It's become good etiquette to mute your microphone when you're
    in an online conference and you're not speaking.  To mute your
    microphone when you're connected, press the "Mute Microphone"
    button below.  You will need to unmute your microphone to speak
    and to sing.</p>

    <p>If your microphone is muted when the others are singing, you
    will be able to hear them in real-time.  However, if you mute your
    microphone during a recording you will not be able to re-join the
    recording even if you unmute the microphone.</p>

    <button>Mute Microphone</button>

    <p>Your microphone is currently unmuted but not live.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring</h2>

    <p>During rehearsal, the conductor will instigate recordings.
    During recordings, if your microphone is live and unmuted, you
    will hear a backing track and you may also monitor your own
    recording.  (You will not be able to hear the others singing in
    real time.)</p>

    <p>To enable monitoring select the checkbox below:</p>

    <input type="checkbox"> Enable monitoring

    <p>You will then hear a mix of the backing track and yourself.  To
    change the relative loudness of the two sources, adjust the
    position of the slider below:</p>

    Backing Track <input type="range"> Monitor

    
    <h2>Volume</h2>
    
    <p>To make the sound that you hear louder or quieter, adjust the
      volume on your computer or headset.</p>

    
    <h2>State</h2>

    <p>You are not currently connected to a rehearsal space.</p>
    

    <h2>Leaving</h2>

    <p>If you wish to leave the rehearsal, you may click on the button
      "Leave Rehearsal".  You may reconnect after leaving if the
      rehearsal is still ongoing.</p>

    <button>Leave Rehearsal</button
